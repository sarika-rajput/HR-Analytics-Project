## Project Overview

HR Analytics involves analyzing human resource (HR) data to enhance workforce management and drive strategic decision-making. The HR Analytics Dashboard is a visual tool that offers deep insights into our workforce, enabling data-driven decisions to improve employee satisfaction and retention. By using Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and SQL, the dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to monitor key metrics such as employee engagement, turnover, retention, and productivity in real-time. SQL is used to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a unified database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for analysis. The dashboard offers a thorough understanding of attrition trends, helping HR professionals and decision-makers track performance, identify trends, and customize the dashboard to suit specific needs and preferences, ultimately enhancing workforce management and decision-making.
